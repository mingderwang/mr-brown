## Markdown plus h2 with a custom ID ##         {#id-goes-here}
[Link back to H2](#id-goes-here)

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](http://warpedvisions.org), and a literal . 
Now some SimpleLinks, like one to [google] (automagically links to are-you-
feeling-lucky), a [wiki: test] link to a Wikipedia page, and a link to 
[foldoc: CPU]s at foldoc.  

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`. Note that underscores in 
words are ignored in Markdown Extra.


> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

~~~

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}

~~~

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

### Horizontal rules
